# Calculator Documentation

## Introduction

This Python script implements a graphical calculator using the Tkinter library. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Features

1. **User Interface:**
   - The calculator has a clean and visually appealing interface with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, backspace (‚Üê), and clear (C).
   - The equal button (=) is prominently displayed for evaluating mathematical expressions.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Mathematical expressions are evaluated using Python's `eval` function.
   - The script includes error handling for common issues such as syntax errors, zero division errors, and invalid input values. Users receive informative error messages in case of an error.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Users can input mathematical expressions by clicking the buttons or using the keyboard.
   - The backspace button removes the last character from the input.
   - The clear button resets the input field.
   - The equal button calculates the result of the entered expression.

4. **Styling and Customization:**
   - The calculator uses a color scheme to enhance visual appeal.
   - Buttons are configured with consistent styling, including font, background color, and width.

5. **Resizable Window:**
   - The script allows users to resize the calculator window for a more customized user experience.

6. **Icon:**
   - An icon (`calculator.ico`) is associated with the calculator window.

## Usage

1. **Running the Script:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python main.py`).

2. **Calculator Interface:**
   - Use the graphical interface to input mathematical expressions.
   - Click the buttons to input digits, operators, and other symbols.
   - Use the backspace button to delete the last character.
   - Use the clear button to reset the input field.
   - Click the equal button to calculate the result.

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Explore keyboard shortcuts for a more efficient input experience.
   - For example, try using the Enter key to trigger the calculation.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script according to your preferences or specific requirements. You can adjust the color scheme, button styling, and add new features based on your needs.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `calculator.ico` icon file is in the same directory as the script.
- You can choose to run either the `Calculator.exe` file to launch the calculator application without python.
